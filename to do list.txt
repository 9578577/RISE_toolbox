1- smooth transition estimation?
2- finish the forecast routine, importing functions from earlier work
7- how to implement the dirichlet distribution in the estimation of markov switching with more than 2 transition probabilities?
8- learn GIT & GITHUB
9- there are restrictions from the model and other restrictions that possibly may use the whole model. This needs separation and clarification
10- Re-write the parser: parameterization out of the file?
11- p.alpha={chain,state,start,ms(distr,m,s,lb,ub)}
12- p.alpha={chain,state,start,qtls(distr,plb,pub,prob,lb,ub)}
