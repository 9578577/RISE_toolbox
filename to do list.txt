1- smooth transition estimation?
2- possibility of selecting range to plot, highlighting and using tex_names in dyn_ts/plot
3- automatic differentiation?
4- symbolic differentiation?
5- perturbation methods?
6- finish the forecast routine, importing functions from other work
7- how to implement the dirichlet distribution in the estimation of markov switching with more than 2 transition probabilities?
8- learn GIT
9- there are restrictions from the model and other restrictions that possibly may use the whole model. This needs separation and clarification
